# TowerDefense for BlackBerry10!

The scope is to create a simple and easy game for all those Tower defense lovers. 

---

Why do this?
Because we though it would be fun to make our own tower defense game while learning to increase our skills as a group.

I'm using the following to develop this :

  * Phaser.io
  * Blackberry Webworks
  * TypeScript
  * HTML5
  * CSS3
